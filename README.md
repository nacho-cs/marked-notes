### An easy way to take notes with markdown

- Write markdown in the left box, and it will be processed and it will appear in the right box.
- Share your notes by either copying your notes, copying the link to your notes, or exporting an image of your notes.
- Your text is also saved, so if you accidentally refresh, everything is not gone.
